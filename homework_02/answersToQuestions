Q1) What will be the order of execution between setImmediate(callback) and setTimeout(callback,0) ?

Answer:

When setTimeout is set to be 0, they have they same kind of priority but which get executed first will be determine by
other factors.

setImmediate: will wait for until all I/O handlers which are in the queue gets executed and then setImmediate will be 
executed.

setTimeout: will wait for until all the event functions which are in the queue gets executed and then setTimeout will be 
executed.

Q2)Explain the difference between process.nextTick and setImmediate? what will be the execution order ?

Answer:

process.nextTick Vs setImmediate: process.nextTick is going to be queued in the "next tick queue" which is not in 
the order of event loop instead it is checks after current operation and it always gets executed after the current 
operation ends. setImmediate on the other hand it is queued in the check phase of the event loop and gets executed when 
the check phase is reached.

Order of execution:
process.nextTick: A function passed to process.nextTick() is going to be executed on the current iteration of the 
event loop, after the current operation ends.

setImmediate: the queue containing the callbacks of this, will be executed once in every iteration 
when event loop is in Check phase.
